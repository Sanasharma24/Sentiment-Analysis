# Sentiment-Analysis
This project demonstrates the implementation of sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa model, a state-of-the-art NLP model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is fine-tuned on a Twitter sentiment dataset and is capable of classifying text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment categories.
