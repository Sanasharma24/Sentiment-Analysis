# üö¶ Sentiment Analysis: Comparing VADER and RoBERTa

Welcome! This project explores and compares two powerful approaches to sentiment analysis:  
- **VADER** (a fast, rule-based model ideal for social media and short texts)  
- **RoBERTa** (a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model for nuanced understanding)

My goal is to **analyze the strengths, weaknesses, and practical differences** between these models when classifying text as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.

---

## üéØ Main Goal

To **compare the performance, accuracy, and behavior of VADER and RoBERTa** on the same sentiment analysis tasks, and to provide insights into which model is better suited for different scenarios.

---

## üß≠ How Does It Work?

1. **Dataset Selection:**  
   We use the [Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews), which contains thousands of real-world text reviews and their star ratings.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   - **VADER:** Uses NLTK‚Äôs VADER lexicon for fast, rule-based sentiment scoring.
   - **RoBERTa:** Uses Hugging Face‚Äôs `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment` for deep learning-based sentiment classification.

4. **Comparison & Evaluation:**  
   - Run both models on the same reviews.
   - Compare their predictions, probability scores, and overall accuracy.
   - Visualize results with charts and tables.

5. **Interpretation:**  
   - Discuss where each model excels or struggles, and why.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Side-by-side sentiment predictions** from VADER and RoBERTa.
- **Probability/confidence scores** for each sentiment class.
- **Clear visualizations** to highlight differences in model behavior.
- **Well-commented, beginner-friendly code** in a Jupyter Notebook.
